### Learning Module 3

#### Background information - Rational Method

The **Rational Method** is a type of simple hydrological analysis used to estimate the *peak runoff rate* from a small watershed during a rainfall event. It is particularly useful for estimating the amount of water that will flow through a particular area during a storm, like a drainage system or culvert. Despite the existence of more advanced methods, this approach remains widely used in practice for its simplicity and ability to provide quick approximations, making it invaluable for preliminary assessments and as a foundation for understanding more complex hydrological and environmental modeling techniques.

Here is a 5-minute video to get started:

Some helpful terminology:

<u>runoff coefficient</u> - represents how much rainfall actually becomes runoff<br>
<u>time of concentration</u> - the time it takes for some mass of precipitation to travel from the most remote point in a watershed to the outlet or point of interest. e.g., how long it takes a drop of rain to reach a culvert after it falls to the ground. 

#### Background information - Curve Number

The NRCS (Natural Resources Conservation Science) **curve number** (CN) is a tool used to estimate the *total runoff volume* of water that will run off an ungaged watershed during a storm event. The curve number is based on soil type, land use and antecedent moisture conditions. You may also see SCS CN in texts. NRCS was previously known as Soil Conservation Science, they are the same.
It was designed as a simple tool to describe typical watershed response from infrequent rainfall anywhere in the US for watersheds with the same soil type, land use, and surface runoff conditions. The CN method is a single event model to estimate of runoff volume from rainfall events (not peak discharge or a hydrograph). 

To understand the function and derivation of the CN number, let's start with the <br>
the NRCS runoff equation:

$$
Q = \frac{{(P - I_{a})^2}}{{P - I_{a} + S}}
$$
Where Q = runoff(in) <br>
P = rainfall (in) <br>
S = potential maximum retention after runoff begins
I<sub>a</sub> = initial abstraction (initial amount of rainfall that is intercepted by the watershed surface and does not immediately contribute to runoff)

I<sub>a</sub> is assumed to reduce to 0.2S based on empirical observations by NRCS. If:
$$
S = \frac{{1000}}{{CN}} - 10
$$
the runoff equation therefore reduces to:
$$
Q = \frac{{[P - 0.02\left(\frac{{1000}}{{CN}} - 10\right)]^2}}{{P + 0.8\left(\frac{{1000}}{{CN}} - 10\right)}}
$$
