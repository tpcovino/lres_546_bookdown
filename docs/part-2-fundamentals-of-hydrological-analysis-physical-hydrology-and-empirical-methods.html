<p>Streamflow can come from a range of water sources. When it is not raining, streams are fed by the slow drainage of groundwater. When a rainstorm occurs, streamflow increases and water enters the stream more quickly. The rate at which water reaches the stream and the partitioning between groundwater and faster flow pathways is variable across watersheds. It is important to understand how water is partitioned between fast and slow pathways (baseflow and stormflow) and what controls this partitioning in order to better predict susceptibility to flooding and if and how groundwater can sustain streamflow in long periods of drought.</p>
<p>In this module we will introduce the components of streamflow during a rain event, and how event water moves through a hillslope to reach a stream. We will discuss methods for partitioning a hydrograph between baseflow (groundwater) and storm flow (event water). Finally, we will explore how characteristics of a watershed might lead to more or less water being partitioned into baseflow vs. stormflow. We will test understanding through evaluating data collected from watersheds in West Virginia to determine how mountaintop mining, which fundamentally changed the watershed structure, affects baseflow.</p>

<p>During a rainstorm, precipitation is falling across the watershed: close to the stream, on a hillslope, and up at the watershed divide. This water that falls across the watershed flows downslope toward the stream via a number of flow pathways. Here we define and describe the basic flow pathways during a rain event.<br />
The first component is <strong>channel interception</strong>. This is water that falls directly on the water surface of the stream. The amount of water that falls directly on the channel is a function of stream size, if we have a very small, narrow creek, this will be a very small quantity. However, you can imagine that in a very large, broad river such as the Amazon, this volume of water is much larger. Channel interception is the first component during a rain event that causes streamflow to increase because it is contributing directly to the stream and therefore has no travel time.</p>
<p>The second is <strong>overland flow</strong>, which is water that flows on the land surface to the stream. Overland flow can occur via a number of mechanisms which we will not explore too deeply here, but encourage further study on your own (resources provided). Briefly, overland flow includes water that falls on an impermeable surface such as pavement, water that runs downslope due to rain falling faster than the rate at which it can infiltrate the ground surface, and water that flows over the land surface because the ground is completely saturated. Overland flow is typically faster than water that travels through soils and deeper flow pathways and therefore is the next major component that starts to contribute to the increase in streamflow during a rain event.</p>
<p>The third component is <strong>subsurface flow</strong>. This is water that infiltrates the land surface and flows downslope through shallow groundwater flow pathways. This is the last component that increases streamflow during a storm event, is the slowest of the stormflow components, and can contribute to elevated streamflow for a while after precipitation ends.</p>
<p>The final component is <strong>baseflow</strong>. Baseflow can also be described as groundwater. This component is what sustains streamflow between rain events, but also continues to contribute during a rain event. Of water that infiltrates the ground surface, some moves quickly to the stream as subsurface flow, but some moves deeper and becomes part of deeper groundwater and baseflow. Thus baseflow can increase in times of higher wetness in the watershed, particularly during and right after rainy seasons or spring snowmelt.</p>
<p>We can simplify this partitioning into <strong>baseflow</strong> and <strong>stormflow</strong> (often called quickflow). Baseflow being groundwater that moves more slowly and sustains streamflow between rain events. Stormflow is water that contributes to streamflow as a result of a rain event. Under this definition we can lump <strong>channel interception, overland flow</strong>, and <strong>subsurface</strong> flow into <strong>stormflow</strong>.</p>

<p>When rain falls on the land surface, much of it infiltrates into the soil. Water moves through the soil column until it meets a layer of lower permeability and runs down the hillslope as subsurface flow. This layer of lower permeability allows some water to move through it, contributing to groundwater. Frequently the layer of lower permeability is the interface between soil and rock. Therefore the depth of soil has a large effect on how much water moves through soil vs. how much moves deeper into groundwater, becoming baseflow.</p>

<p>It is impossible to know the amount of water moving as overland, subsurface, and base flow in all parts of a watershed. So in order to quantify how much water in a stream at any given time is storm flow vs. baseflow, we need to use some simplified methods (i.e., modeling). These frequently involve using the hydrograph (plot of streamflow over time) drawing lines, and calculating the volume of water above and below the line. This can be somewhat arbitrary and there are a variety of methods for delineating the cutoff between baseflow and stormflow. Despite what method you use and how simplified it is, this technique still provides valuable information and allows us to make comparisons across watersheds in order to understand how they function and what their structural properties are.</p>

<p>One of the most basic methods for calculating base flow vs. storm flow is the straight line method. First, find the value of discharge at the point that streamflow begins to rise due to a storm. A straight line is drawn at that value until it intersects with the hydrograph (i.e. streamflow recedes back to the discharge it was at before the rainfall event started. Anything below this line is base flow and anything above it is storm flow.</p>
<p><img src="images/straight_line_baseflow_separation.jpg" /></p>
<p>We learned above that some rainfall can move deep into the soil profile and contribute to baseflow. We might expect baseflow to increase over time and thus would want to use a method that can account for this.</p>
<p>An addition to the straight line method was posed by Hewlett and Hibbert, 1967. This method, which we’ll call the Hewlett and Hibbert method finds the discharge at the starting point of a storm. Then, rather than a straight line of 0 slope and in the straight line method, we assume a slope of 0.05 cubic feet per second per square mile. The line with this calculated slope is drawn until it intersects with the hydrograph receding at the end of the storm.</p>
<p><img src="images/HH_baseflow_separation.jpg" /></p>
<p>There are myriad other methods for baseflow separation of a wide range of complexity. We will give an example of one more method: a recursive filter method established by Lyne and Hollick (1976). This method smooths the hydrograph and partitions part of that smoothed signal into baseflow. The equation for this method is:</p>
<p><img src="images/Screen%20Shot%202020-08-12%20at%202.12.08%20PM.png" /></p>
<p>You can see from this equation that a filter parameter, a, must be chosen. This parameter can be decided by the user, takes a value between 0 and 1, and is typically close to 1. Additionally this filtering method must be constrained so that baseflow is not negative or greater than the total streamflow. Output from this method for the Harvey River in Australia is originally published in Lyne and Hollick (1976) below (notice in the caption that the a parameter was set to 0.8):</p>

<p>The way a watershed is structured has a strong control on how water is partitioned into baseflow and stormflow. Below is a list of key structural properties:
Land Use and Land Cover: If a watershed is developed or natural can dictate how much water infiltrates the land surface and how quickly. For example, a watershed with lots of pavement means that much more water will be overland flow with fewer opportunities to recharge baseflow. Furthermore, how a watershed is developed will affect partitioning. For example a residential area with houses on large, grassy lots will allow for more infiltration than a shopping center with large parking lots. Land cover in natural areas will also affect partitioning. Some other variables to consider may be: <br/>
Land cover in natural areas: a dense forest vs. a recently harvested hillside. <br/>
Soil type: clayey soils vs. sandy soils <br/>
Depth to impeding layer: could be the bedrock interface, but could also be a low permeability clay layer in the soil <br/>
Permeability of the underlying rock: Highly fractured sandstone vs. solid granite
Slope: steeper slopes vs. flatter areas <br/></p>
<p>The partitioning is a combination of all of these factors. A watershed may have a very low slope, suggesting that it might have less stormflow. But if the soils in this watershed have an impermeable clay layer near the soil surface, a lot more water may end up as stormflow than one would expect.</p>

When you get to GitHub click on “Code” (green button) and select “download zip”. You will then save this to a local folder where you should do all of your work for this class. You will work through the “_blank.Rmd” or “_partial.Rmd”. Always be sure to read the README.md files in the GitHub repo. Sometimes they are useful, sometimes they aren’t, but always have a look.
As I mentioned above you will work through the “_blank.Rmd” or “_partial.Rmd”. If you want to learn how to code in R, I encourage you to work through the blank version as much as possible. Also, if you don’t have much R background this lab might seem kind of challenging. But don’t worry. I’m challenging you right now, but it will get easier, and we can video chat if a live demonstration is needed. So don’t get frustrated if this seems tough right now. Soon you will be rattling off code with ease. Conversely, if you are an experienced coder and have ideas for how to do this in ways other than what I’ve shown here, please share code with your colleagues and help them develop their coding skills!</p>
<p>Once you have this folder saved where you would like it, open RStudio and navigate to the folder. Next, open the project (“.Rproj”). Doing so will set the folder as the working directory, make your life easier, and make everything generally work. The use of projects is highly recommended and is the practice we will follow in this class.

<p>In this lab we will look at some precipitation data to get an idea of return intervals for a given rain event. A return interval is the inverse of the probability. So if a certain rain even has a 10% probability of happening any year it has a 1/p return interval, so: R = 1/0.1 = 10 years. This means on average you can expect that size event about every ten years. From a probability perspective it is actually more correct to state that there is a 10% chance of that size rain event in any year. The reason this is better is that it communicates that you certainly can have a 10% probability event occur in back-to-back years.</p>
<p>After computing some return intervals we will then use some of the simpler rainfall-runoff modeling approaches (the rational method and the curve number method) to simulate runoff for a hypothetical basin in our next unit.</p>

<p>First, let’s start by getting some precipitation (P) data. rnoaa has a function called ghcnd_stations(). This function will download the site information for all stations in the GHCND network.</p>
<p>GHCND network
- <a href="https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/land-based-station/global-historical-climatology-network-daily" target="_blank">Link</a></p>
<p>Ok, so we want station USC00241044, which runs from 1892 to now. We use the meteo_pull_monitors() function to do that.</p>
<p>Now we have some climate data. Take a minute to look at the climate_data df. First, just looking at the df we see that the data don’t actually start until 1894. It is also always a good idea to just plot some data. Below plot prcp, snow, tmax and tmin. You can just make 4 different plots. This is just for visual inspection. This part of the process is called exploratory data analysis (EDA). This should always be the first step when downloading data whether you download the data from the internet or from a sensor in the field.</p>
<p>You might have noticed that the values seem to be much too large! Did you notice that? This is a great skill to develop. Have a look at the data and ask “are these numbers reasonable?”. In this case, the answer would be no!</p>
<p>One thing to note is that NOAA data comes in tenths of degrees for temp and tenths of millimeters for precip. Type ?meteo_pull_monitors into the console and the help screen will tell you that. So, we need to clean up the df a bit. Let’s do that here.</p>
<p>Now that we’ve converted units, it is a good idea to plot your data again for some EDA. Make plots of each of the variables (prcp, snow, tmax, and tmin) over time to inspect.</p>
<p>How do the data look? Do they make sense? Do you see any strange values?</p>
<p>There is a large snow event in 1951. We can assume that is “real”, so let’s keep it in the analysis. But you should think through how you could exclude it from the analysis. How could you use the filter function to do that?</p>
<p>Next, we want to use some skills from the hydrograph sep lab to add a water year (WY) column. Try that here.</p>
<p>I like to rearrange the order of columns. Using:</p>
<p>Now, create a new df called climate_an where you calculate the total P (i.e., the sum) for each water year. Use group_by and summarize (or better yet, reframe). Also keep in mind that you will need to deal with NA values in the df. How do you do that in summarize? As a note, reframe can be used instead of summarize and is a more general purpose function. You can try each.</p>
<p>What happens if you don’t deal with NA values by using something like na.rm = TRUE?</p>
<p>Now, plot total anual P on the Y and water year on the x. What do you see?</p>
<p>Now let’s calculate some probabilities. Look up the <code>pnorm()</code> function for this (either type it into the Help window, or type ?pnorm in the console. You only need x, the mean, and standard deviation (sd) for the calculations.</p>
<p><strong>Q1. (3 pts) What is the probability that the annual precipitation in a given year is less than 400 mm? This is the F(A) in the CDF in the probability lecture slides.</strong></p>

<p>The <strong>Rational Method</strong> is a type of simple hydrological analysis used to estimate the <em>peak runoff rate</em> from a small watershed during a rainfall event. It is particularly useful for estimating the amount of water that will flow through a particular area during a storm, like a drainage system or culvert. Despite the existence of more advanced methods, this approach remains widely used in practice for its simplicity and ability to provide quick approximations, making it invaluable for preliminary assessments and as a foundation for understanding more complex hydrological and environmental modeling techniques.</p>

<p>The NRCS (Natural Resources Conservation Science) <strong>curve number</strong> (CN) is a tool used to estimate the <em>total runoff volume</em> of water that will run off an ungaged watershed during a storm event. The curve number is based on soil type, land use and antecedent moisture conditions. You may also see SCS CN in texts. NRCS was previously known as Soil Conservation Science, they are the same.
It was designed as a simple tool to describe typical watershed response from infrequent rainfall anywhere in the US for watersheds with the same soil type, land use, and surface runoff conditions. The CN method is a single event model to estimate of runoff volume from rainfall events (not peak discharge or a hydrograph).</p>
<p>To understand the function and derivation of the CN number, let’s start with the <br>
the NRCS runoff equation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
Q = \frac{{(P - I_{a})^2}}{{P - I_{a} + S}}
\]</span>
Where Q = runoff(in) <br>
P = rainfall (in) <br>
S = potential maximum retention after runoff begins
I<sub>a</sub> = initial abstraction (initial amount of rainfall that is intercepted by the watershed surface and does not immediately contribute to runoff)</p>
<p>I<sub>a</sub> is assumed to reduce to 0.2S based on empirical observations by NRCS. If:
<span class="math display">\[
S = \frac{{1000}}{{CN}} - 10
\]</span>
the runoff equation therefore reduces to:
<span class="math display">\[
Q = \frac{{[P - 0.02\left(\frac{{1000}}{{CN}} - 10\right)]^2}}{{P + 0.8\left(\frac{{1000}}{{CN}} - 10\right)}}
\]</span></p>

<p>The goal is to calculate peak runoff (cfs) for a small 280-acre rangeland watershed near Bozeman for multiple events with different return periods. You will first have to calculate the time of concentration and then look up the the rainfall values for the different return intervals. The longest flowpath in the watershed is 6300 ft long, average watershed slope is 1.95%. Look at this <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/tkofgmpnroug8wwe8x16z/Rational.Method.C.png?rlkey=qgcyayk10j94is3hwjfxuzwz5&amp;dl=0">table</a> to select C.</p>

<ul>
<li>Time of concentration is the time it takes water to travel along the longest flowpath in the watershed and exit the watershed.</li>

<p>Now that you have the time of concentration, you need to find the corresponding 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100 year storm depths for a duration that works for the Rational Method in that particular watershed (that is, the duration that is closest to tc). Create a dataframe (or ‘tibble’ which is the tidyverse data frame) called “storms” that has a column for the return period, Tr, the storm depth, Pin, and the average storm intensity over ONE HOUR, Pin_hr. Typically hourly depths may be determined from a rainfall analysis. For the sake of the assignment, approximate daily depths corresponding to appropriate frequencies are provided here for Bozeman, MT.

<h5><span class="header-section-number">2.3.2.1.3</span> Example for-loop<a href="part-2-fundamentals-of-hydrological-analysis-physical-hydrology-and-empirical-methods.html#example-for-loop" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h5>
<p>Now that we have the rainfall intensities, we need to set up a way that calculates Qp for each of those intensities, without us having to go back and manually enter them each time. We do this with a for-loop. Let’s first look at how for loops work in R.</p>
<p>A for-loop will execute the code inside it for a specified number of iterations. The structure looks like:
for(i in some number of iterations) {
output &lt;- some code/function that needs to be executed
}
In the chunk below, we create the vector x, which contains 6 values (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10). Each loop then executes a calculation using each value in ‘x’ in sequence.
In a for-loop, ‘i’ is called the loop index or iterator. It has a new value in each iteration of the loop. You can think of i as a ‘counter’ that helps the loop keep track of its progress. In the example below, we want to run the code in the loop for every value in the vector ‘x’. Since there are 6 values in vector ‘x’, then we will tell the loop to run 6 times. However, rather than for (i in 1:6), using 1:length(x) ensures the loop adapts to the size of x, no matter how many values it contains. This improves the flexibility of our code.
We also need to store the output of loop during each iteration. If we don’t store the results of each iteration or loop, the loop will overwrite the output each time, leaving us with only the result from the final iteration. To store the output of each loop iteration, we have to preallocate a vector (like y) to store all of the outputs. In other words, we are creating an empty vector with the same length as ‘x’ for the for-loop to add values to.</p>
<p>We have created a vector x from 0 to 10 in increments of 2. The for-loop takes each element of that vector and squares it. The “i” is called an index and runs from 1 through 6 (the length of x). During the first iteration i is 1, during the second iteration i is 2, and so on. We are then writing the results from the calculation into a new vector, y. When i is 1, we are squaring the first value in vector x, which is 0. The first value in y will be zero as well. When i is 2, the second value in x gets squared, which is 2^2. The second value in y is going to be 4.</p>

<p>Now let’s set up the for-loop for the Rational Method. We need to set up a for-loop that does the same calculation 7 times, the number of precip values in “storms”. However, ‘length()’ for a dataframe returns the number of columns, so you want to use ‘nrow()’ when referencing a dataframe. (As apposed to using length() for a vector as above). The calculated peak discharges should go into a new column of our “storms” df. However, indexing is slow for dataframes, so we will write the new values into a new vector, Qp, and then after the loop insert the vector as a column into the dataframe.<br>

<p>Now plot the return interval against the storm peakflow.

<p>In this exercise we will write a function that takes the necessary inputs for the NRCS CN method and returns a value based on the parameters. This is not fully automated, you will still have to look up the CN yourself for a given land use. The goal is to write a function that requires P, CN, and AMC (antecedent moisture condition) as an input in order to calculate Q.</p>

<p>Let’s look at a simple example for a function. Assume we want a number with an exponent and we want to be able to choose both the base and the exponent. The function ‘function()’ defines the inputs in (), the actual calculation then follows in {}.</p>
<p>Run the above function. You will notice that a function was added to the Global Environment all the way at the bottom. Now let’s test the function with a base of 2 and an exponent of 3. This should perform the calculation 2x2x2 = 8</p>

<p>Before we write a function to estimate Q using CN, let’s make sure we can set up the correct steps WITHOUT the function. This is almost always a helpful step in developing functions. It can save hours of headaches later. Let’s try P = 2.5 inches, CN = 90, and AMC = 3.
The biggest problem here is going to be creating a lookup table for the AMC. I will provide the basic structure of the code for this.</p>

ANSWER:</p>
<p>Now write a function called “scs_cn” that takes the inputs P, CN, and AMC (all numeric) and returns Q, Ia, Si, and the RR as a df called “scs_out”.
