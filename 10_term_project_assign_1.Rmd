## Term Project Assignment 1 - 10 pnts

As part of your graduate program, whether you are a GA or part of the Professional Masters’ Program, you are required to develop a professional paper. It is intended to give you an in-depth experience in the design, implementation, and completion of an original project. The paper will also be a way to showcase your research interests and accomplishments to potential employers or admissions committees. (See LRES 575 for more). 

Your term project for this class is not meant to encompass your entire thesis or dissertation. Instead, it should focus on a single, well-defined component that contributes to your broader research. This could be an in-depth exploration of a specific feature of your research question, a feasibility study, or a clear demonstration of a cause-effect relationship within your work. In the upcoming weeks, you will design a repeatable workflow that is executable within the scope of this semester, and at the end of the term, you will present a concise (~8-minute) synopsis of your question and workflow.

This assignment is focused on data retrieval; you will develop the main goal and objectives of your term project and explore, evaluate, and select data sources. A key component of this process is formulating a research question that clearly defines both an explanatory variable and a response variable; one is not sufficient without the other. The workflow for this assignment will help you refine your question and identify the datasets needed to address it. Your assignment is considered complete when you have identified at least one explanatory variable and one response variable, along with the corresponding data sources.
