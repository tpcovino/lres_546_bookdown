<p>Streamflow can come from a range of water sources. When it is not raining, streams are fed by the slow drainage of groundwater. When a rainstorm occurs, streamflow increases and water enters the stream more quickly. The rate at which water reaches the stream and the partitioning between groundwater and faster flow pathways is variable across watersheds. It is important to understand how water is partitioned between fast and slow pathways (baseflow and stormflow) and what controls this partitioning in order to better predict susceptibility to flooding and if and how groundwater can sustain streamflow in long periods of drought.</p>
<p>In this module we will introduce the components of streamflow during a rain event, and how event water moves through a hillslope to reach a stream. We will discuss methods for partitioning a hydrograph between baseflow (groundwater) and storm flow (event water). Finally, we will explore how characteristics of a watershed might lead to more or less water being partitioned into baseflow vs. stormflow. We will test understanding through evaluating data collected from watersheds in West Virginia to determine how mountaintop mining, which fundamentally changed the watershed structure, affects baseflow.</p>

<p>During a rainstorm, precipitation is falling across the watershed: close to the stream, on a hillslope, and up at the watershed divide. This water that falls across the watershed flows downslope toward the stream via a number of flow pathways. Here we define and describe the basic flow pathways during a rain event.<br />
The first component is <strong>channel interception</strong>. This is water that falls directly on the water surface of the stream. The amount of water that falls directly on the channel is a function of stream size, if we have a very small, narrow creek, this will be a very small quantity. However, you can imagine that in a very large, broad river such as the Amazon, this volume of water is much larger. Channel interception is the first component during a rain event that causes streamflow to increase because it is contributing directly to the stream and therefore has no travel time.</p>
<p>The second is <strong>overland flow</strong>, which is water that flows on the land surface to the stream. Overland flow can occur via a number of mechanisms which we will not explore too deeply here, but encourage further study on your own (resources provided). Briefly, overland flow includes water that falls on an impermeable surface such as pavement, water that runs downslope due to rain falling faster than the rate at which it can infiltrate the ground surface, and water that flows over the land surface because the ground is completely saturated. Overland flow is typically faster than water that travels through soils and deeper flow pathways and therefore is the next major component that starts to contribute to the increase in streamflow during a rain event.</p>
<p>The third component is <strong>subsurface flow</strong>. This is water that infiltrates the land surface and flows downslope through shallow groundwater flow pathways. This is the last component that increases streamflow during a storm event, is the slowest of the stormflow components, and can contribute to elevated streamflow for a while after precipitation ends.</p>
<p>The final component is <strong>baseflow</strong>. Baseflow can also be described as groundwater. This component is what sustains streamflow between rain events, but also continues to contribute during a rain event. Of water that infiltrates the ground surface, some moves quickly to the stream as subsurface flow, but some moves deeper and becomes part of deeper groundwater and baseflow. Thus baseflow can increase in times of higher wetness in the watershed, particularly during and right after rainy seasons or spring snowmelt.</p>
<p>We can simplify this partitioning into <strong>baseflow</strong> and <strong>stormflow</strong> (often called quickflow). Baseflow being groundwater that moves more slowly and sustains streamflow between rain events. Stormflow is water that contributes to streamflow as a result of a rain event. Under this definition we can lump <strong>channel interception, overland flow</strong>, and <strong>subsurface</strong> flow into <strong>stormflow</strong>.</p>

<p>When rain falls on the land surface, much of it infiltrates into the soil. Water moves through the soil column until it meets a layer of lower permeability and runs down the hillslope as subsurface flow. This layer of lower permeability allows some water to move through it, contributing to groundwater. Frequently the layer of lower permeability is the interface between soil and rock. Therefore the depth of soil has a large effect on how much water moves through soil vs. how much moves deeper into groundwater, becoming baseflow.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.1.1.7</span> How we quantify baseflow<a href="fundamentals-of-hydrological-analysis---physical-hydrology-and-empirical-methods.html#how-we-quantify-baseflow" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>It is impossible to know the amount of water moving as overland, subsurface, and base flow in all parts of a watershed. So in order to quantify how much water in a stream at any given time is storm flow vs. baseflow, we need to use some simplified methods (i.e., modeling). These frequently involve using the hydrograph (plot of streamflow over time) drawing lines, and calculating the volume of water above and below the line. This can be somewhat arbitrary and there are a variety of methods for delineating the cutoff between baseflow and stormflow. Despite what method you use and how simplified it is, this technique still provides valuable information and allows us to make comparisons across watersheds in order to understand how they function and what their structural properties are.</p>

<p>One of the most basic methods for calculating base flow vs. storm flow is the straight line method. First, find the value of discharge at the point that streamflow begins to rise due to a storm. A straight line is drawn at that value until it intersects with the hydrograph (i.e. streamflow recedes back to the discharge it was at before the rainfall event started. Anything below this line is base flow and anything above it is storm flow.</p>
<p><img src="images/straight_line_baseflow_separation.jpg" /></p>
<p>We learned above that some rainfall can move deep into the soil profile and contribute to baseflow. We might expect baseflow to increase over time and thus would want to use a method that can account for this.</p>
<p>An addition to the straight line method was posed by Hewlett and Hibbert, 1967. This method, which we’ll call the Hewlett and Hibbert method finds the discharge at the starting point of a storm. Then, rather than a straight line of 0 slope and in the straight line method, we assume a slope of 0.05 cubic feet per second per square mile. The line with this calculated slope is drawn until it intersects with the hydrograph receding at the end of the storm.</p>
<p><img src="images/HH_baseflow_separation.jpg" /></p>
<p>There are myriad other methods for baseflow separation of a wide range of complexity. We will give an example of one more method: a recursive filter method established by Lyne and Hollick (1976). This method smooths the hydrograph and partitions part of that smoothed signal into baseflow. The equation for this method is:</p>
<p><img src="images/Screen%20Shot%202020-08-12%20at%202.12.08%20PM.png" /></p>
<p>You can see from this equation that a filter parameter, a, must be chosen. This parameter can be decided by the user, takes a value between 0 and 1, and is typically close to 1. Additionally this filtering method must be constrained so that baseflow is not negative or greater than the total streamflow. Output from this method for the Harvey River in Australia is originally published in Lyne and Hollick (1976) below (notice in the caption that the a parameter was set to 0.8):</p>

<p>The way a watershed is structured has a strong control on how water is partitioned into baseflow and stormflow. Below is a list of key structural properties:
Land Use and Land Cover: If a watershed is developed or natural can dictate how much water infiltrates the land surface and how quickly. For example, a watershed with lots of pavement means that much more water will be overland flow with fewer opportunities to recharge baseflow. Furthermore, how a watershed is developed will affect partitioning. For example a residential area with houses on large, grassy lots will allow for more infiltration than a shopping center with large parking lots. Land cover in natural areas will also affect partitioning. Some other variables to consider may be: <br/>
Land cover in natural areas: a dense forest vs. a recently harvested hillside. <br/>
Soil type: clayey soils vs. sandy soils <br/>
Depth to impeding layer: could be the bedrock interface, but could also be a low permeability clay layer in the soil <br/>
Permeability of the underlying rock: Highly fractured sandstone vs. solid granite
Slope: steeper slopes vs. flatter areas <br/></p>
<p>The partitioning is a combination of all of these factors. A watershed may have a very low slope, suggesting that it might have less stormflow. But if the soils in this watershed have an impermeable clay layer near the soil surface, a lot more water may end up as stormflow than one would expect.</p>

<p>Follow this <a href="https://github.com/tpcovino/01_hydrograph_sep" target="_blank">link</a> to download everything you need for this unit. When you get to GitHub click on “Code” (green button) and select “download zip”. You will then save this to a local folder where you should do all of your work for this class. You will work through the “_blank.Rmd” or “_partial.Rmd”. Always be sure to read the README.md files in the GitHub repo. Sometimes they are useful, sometimes they aren’t, but always have a look.
As I mentioned above you will work through the “_blank.Rmd” or “_partial.Rmd”. If you want to learn how to code in R, I encourage you to work through the blank version as much as possible. Also, if you don’t have much R background this lab might seem kind of challenging. But don’t worry. I’m challenging you right now, but it will get easier, and we can video chat if a live demonstration is needed. So don’t get frustrated if this seems tough right now. Soon you will be rattling off code with ease. Conversely, if you are an experienced coder and have ideas for how to do this in ways other than what I’ve shown here, please share code with your colleagues and help them develop their coding skills!</p>
<p>Once you have this folder saved where you would like it, open RStudio and navigate to the folder. Next, open the project (“.Rproj”). Doing so will set the folder as the working directory, make your life easier, and make everything generally work. The use of projects is highly recommended and is the practice we will follow in this class. See <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2017/12/workflow-vs-script/">here</a> for an overview of projects and why you should use them from Jenny Bryan.</p>
