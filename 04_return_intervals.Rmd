## Return Intervals 

- In this learning module we will focus on return intervals. We first need to understand return intervals before we can move onto the rational method and curve numbers.

### Learning Module 2
#### Background information

Lecture from colleague Joel Sholtes on precipitation frequency analysis.

Reading on frequency analysis of flow (e.g., floods). You should notice that the frequency analysis is the same whether we apply it to Q (flow) or P (precipitation). So as long as you understand the fundamental principles you will be able to do frequency analysis on either Q or P.

There are also probability lecture slides on D2L. Titled "probability.pptx".
